# Real-Time Sign Language Translation Using LSTM and MediaPipe âœ¨

## Overview

The Sign Language Translator is a real-time system that captures and translates sign language gestures into text. Utilizing computer vision and deep learning, it enables seamless communication between sign language users and non-signers by identifying hand, face, and body movements. The system processes video input, detects keypoints using MediaPipe Holistic, and predicts gestures with an LSTM-based neural network trained on sign language datasets.

## Features
### Real-time Gesture Recognition
- Detects and translates sign language gestures instantly.

### Multi-Body Landmark Tracking
- Recognizes hand, face, and body movements using MediaPipe Holistic.

### Deep Learning-Based Prediction
- Utilizes LSTM neural networks for accurate classification of gestures.
  

## Technologies:
### Programming & Libraries
- **Python**: Main programming language for data processing and deep learning.
- **OpenCV**: Handles real-time video processing and UI display.
- **MediaPipe**: Detects and tracks body keypoints for gesture analysis.
- **NumPy**: Efficient numerical computations and data manipulation.

### Machine Learning & Deep Learning
- **TensorFlow & Keras**: Used to build and train the LSTM-based neural network.
- **Scikit-learn**: Provides utilities for model evaluation and data processing.

### Hardware & Environment
- **Webcam**: Captures video input for real-time processing.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used for developing and testing the model.
